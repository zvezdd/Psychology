    <h1 >PSYCHOLOGY IS MATTER, THAT'S WHY</h1> 
    <p>Essentially, psychology helps people in large part because it <br> can explain why people act the way they do.With this kind of <br> professional insight, a psychologist can help people improve their <br> decision making, stress management and behavior based on <br> understanding past behavior to better predict future behavior</p>

 <h1 class="theme wow animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">TYPES OF PROBLEMS</h1>
<div class="main wow animate__animated animate__fadeInDown">

  <div class="problems">
    <h3>SIMPLE PROBLEMS</h3>
    <p>Simple problems are ones that have a single cause, are well defined and have a clear and unambiguous solution. Working out a route to travel e.g. from Birmingham to Lands’ End is an example of a simple problem (as is finding those lost car keys).</p>
  </div>
  <div class="problems">
    <h3>COMPLEX PROBLEMS</h3>
    <p>Complex problems tend to have multiple causes, are difficult to understand and their solutions can lead to other problems and unintended consequences. Addressing traffic congestion in a busy town is an example of a complex problem.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="problems">
    <h3>WICKED PROBLEMS</h3>
    <p class="wicked-problem">Wicked problems are problems that seem to be so complex it's difficult to envision a solution. Climate change is an example of a wicked problem.</p>
  </div>
</div>


<h1 class="tema">HOW TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEMS?</h1>
<div class="solutions">
 
   <div class="sol wow animate__animated animate__fadeInLeft"><img src="images/b45d46c88f9531594404d054834256aa.png" alt=""></div>
   <div class="sol wow animate__animated animate__zoomIn">
    <div class="solu"><p>1.State the Problem. It might sound obvious but unless you understand exactly <br> what the problem is you are trying to solve it’s going to be <br> very difficult to come up with a solution. The first step is therefore to state exactly what the problem is.</p></div>
    <div class="solu"><p>2.Structure the Problem. Having clearly stated what the problem probably means <br> you now know just how complex, or even wicked, it is. The next <br> step is to structure the problem by breaking down into smaller, hopefully more manageable parts each of which <br> can hopefully be solved through analysis.</p></div>
    <div class="solu"><p>3.Solve the Problem. Having broken the problem down each piece can now be solved <br> separately. The authors of this method suggest three main approached: <br> hypothesis-driven problem solving, issue-driven problem solving, or the creative path of design thinking.</p></div> 
    <div class="solu"><p>4.Sell the Solution. Even if you come up with an amazing and innovative solution to  the problem, <br> if you cannot persuade others of its value and feasibility your amazing <br> idea will never get implemented or ever be known about. When selling always focus  on the solution, <br> not the steps you went through to arrive at it.</p></div>
  </div>
</div>


<div class="conclusion">
  <div class="answer wow animate__animated animate__fadeInUp ">
    <p>Like any technique, problem solving can be learned and practiced. <br> Even the world’s greatest problem solvers are not necessarily smarter <br> than you are. It’s just that they have learnt and practised their skills <br> then mastered them through continuous improvement.</p>
